This Music Store Web App is developed with JAVA Spring, HTML, and CSS. It uses CRUD elements to the music data, and it can only be modified by the admin. This is approved by user authentication and spring security. The data is currently stored in JAVA, but I'm currently working on the web app to transfer the data to a database.
